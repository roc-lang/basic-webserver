These are examples of how to make server programs using `basic-webserver` as the [platform](https://www.roc-lang.org/platforms).
Check out the [basic-cli examples](https://github.com/roc-lang/basic-cli/tree/main/examples) for more, there is a very large overlap in exposed functions between the two platforms.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - If you want to run an example here but don't want to build basic-webserver from source; go to the examples of a specific version: https://github.com/roc-lang/basic-webserver/tree/0.VERSION.0/examples and in the example; replace the `"../platform/main.roc"` with the release link, for example `"https://github.com/roc-lang/basic-webserver/releases/download/0.12.0/Q4h_In-sz1BqAvlpmCsBHhEJnn_YvfRRMiNACB_fBbk.tar.br"`. Next, run with `roc ./examples/YOUREXAMPLE.roc`.
> - To use these examples as is with basic-webserver built from source you'll need to [build the platform first](https://github.com/roc-lang/basic-webserver?tab=readme-ov-file#developing--building-locally).

Feel free to ask [on Zulip](https://roc.zulipchat.com) in the `#beginners` channel if you have questions about making
basic-webserver programs, or if there are functions you'd like to see added to this platform .
